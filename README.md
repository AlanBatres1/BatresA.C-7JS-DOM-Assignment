JS DOM assingment
Description: Made it where you can type in the box number and change the color of the inside of the box to any of the following colors: Red ,Blue ,Purple ,Brown and Yellow

Peer Review: Brock Spacek 
 The code functions as intended. All boxes and intended colors are filled as the assignment states. The only thing I found is when you type in an invalid color, it does break that specific box you are targeting. However, it fixes when you type in a valid color. I think it has something to do with your default case!
