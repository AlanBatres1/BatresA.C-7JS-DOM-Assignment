JS DOM assingment
Description: Brock Spacek

Peer Review: The code functions as intended. All boxes and intended colors are filled as the assignment states. The only thing I found is when you type in an invalid color, it does break that specific box you are targeting. However, it fixes when you type in a valid color. I think it has something to do with your default case!
